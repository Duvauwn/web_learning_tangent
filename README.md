I am beginning to get burnt out in the studying process.

This is a project to take some time off from the structured curiculum I am currently doing but hopefully still progressing in my knowledge and helping my future self.

This project will be to create a portfolio page where I can store my future projects. Getting this up and running will help a lot.

In my portfolio website I want to have:

1. The main web page. This will have links to the other pages and will include links to things like my discord and my github.(make a linkedin)

2. The Portfolio page will contain all of the projects laid out in a neat and easy to read format.

3. The about page will have some knowledge about me, my likes and my goals. This page will also contain links to other websites with my stuff on it.

4. Animations?
